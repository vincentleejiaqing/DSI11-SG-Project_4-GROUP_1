    "\n",
    "This is due the high cost of an undetected WNV (due to health implications) as compared to the cost involved in spraying an area with presticide due to a false alarm.\n",

    "- West Nile Virus is most commmonly spread through infected mosquitos\n",
    "- 20% of people who are infected, develop symptoms ranging from fever, to serious neurological illness and death.\n",
    "- In 2002, first human cases of WNV\twere reported in Chicago. By 2004 the City of Chicago and the Chicago Department of\tPublic Health (CDPH) had established a comprehensive surveillance and control program.\n",
    "- Every week, mosquitos in traps across the city are tested for the virus. The results of these tests infludence when and where the city will spray pesticides.\n",
